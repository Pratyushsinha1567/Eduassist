# INTRODUCTION OF DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES

Department of Mathematical Sciences was started as a section to assist engineering departments of the institute which, in the true sense, pioneered engineering education in the Indian Nation. It soon acquired the status of a full-fledged department in 1985. It did not stagnate thereafter. Over the years it underwent several transformations with the passage of time in tune with the global development, grew up with the changing world, and frequently altered its face. But finally, in 2013 after the transformation of the erstwhile Institute of Technology to Indian Institute of Technology, it got reincarnated as “Department of Mathematical Sciences” to serve the humanity with a greater perspective, not only to act as interfaces to several disciplines but also to act as a hub for creating fundamental knowledge. Upnishadas too say, “Charaiveti”, i.e., keep moving.

Undoubtedly mathematics, in its purest form, has been the department’s prime concern and its growth as the core of the vision. Mathematics is said to be the queen of all sciences. The fact is: it’s the nectar that tastes as the science it describes; it’s the light that illuminates like the colour it is incident on; and it’s the elixir that has kept the laws of nature alive from the moments immemorial and will live through the ages we haven’t yet speculated about.

The department aims to give emphasis to research in analysis, algebra, topology, mathematical transforms etc. However, the art of relating the beauty of mathematics to the growth of science to strengthen knowledge with zeal to finally serve the humankind is the face, the department is recognised by. Be it fluid dynamics, biomechanics, fracture mechanics, digital image processing, generalized thermo-elasticity, heat and mass transfer, cosmology, cryptology and many more fields of applied nature, department’s contribution is enormous in terms of numerous research papers published in reputed international journals over the past few decades. Computing is the glamour of the department. It annexes several dimensions in terms of new and growing areas of research and further facilitates simulation of mathematical models constructed for interdisciplinary areas.

The department runs an Integrated Dual Degree (IDD) programme in Mathematics & Computing which has been so far known as Integrated Master’s Degree (IMD) programme in Mathematics & Computing. This is one of the most sought after courses offered by the institute. The top jobs in terms of annual package are offered for this course, which is a strong indication how popular and useful the course is for the industrial growth, in general, and the software industry, in particular, under present circumstances. Despite the fact that the programme is merely a decade old, some of the students graduating from the department have been offered MS and PhD programmes in the top universities of the world.

# PROGRAMME OBJECTIVE

With the changing face of the world, teaching or learning mathematics in isolation cannot be appreciated. The world is going digital at a tremendous pace seeking even the remote feasibility of automation in order to boost the industrial growth and facilitate the mankind as well. We are heading towards a SMART world with heavenly facilities. This is possible only with the help of mathematics because all algorithms and implementations as well are based on absolute mathematics. It has been therefore planned to equip the engineering students of this Master’s programme, who have strong base of mathematics, with the adequate knowledge of computer science and computing skills. Such students are expected to be well prepared for giving breakthroughs and creating new horizons in the knowledge domain. The students learning several institute engineering courses and computing courses offered by department of Computer Science and Engineering are expected to excel as engineers in this field.

The increasing demand of the industry, offering very handsome packages, for this programme has made it one of the most sought after programmes in IITs and IIT (BHU), in particular. The feedback from the industry received from the Training & Placement Cell is full of appreciation and demands an increase in the strength of such students. This is a clear indication that such graduating engineers are competent enough to serve the industry and the nation and thus the entire the humanity.

# CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

With the aforementioned objective, the new curriculum is based on the innovative concept of providing the students with huge opportunity and sufficient flexibility to choose papers of their choice and liking so that they are tempted to excel in learning and rising to the occasion with handful of contribution.

This Integrated Dual Degree programme has been formed under the strict supervision of Under Graduate Curriculum Review Committee under the leadership of the Director of the Institute. The programme is stream based which gives ample opportunity to the students to come up with their innovative ideas right from the beginning while doing exploratory projects.

The curriculum is full of varieties such as core courses, departmental core electives, open electives, institute engineering/science courses, multi-departmental core courses, projects, dissertation, practicals, humanities, linguistic, human values and management courses etc. The streams for this programme are (i) mathematical modeling and simulation and (ii) coding and security.
